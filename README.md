# RETFoundModel-with-heatmap
**🗓️ 2025-05-04 — Progress Log**
What I did:

- Fine-tuned RETFound_mae on 4-class eye disease dataset (93.96% accuracy).

- Evaluated predictions and analyzed false cases.

- Integrated ViT-LRP for heatmap-based interpretability.

- Quantified central attention ratios across diseases.

- Identified low focus on lens center in some cataract cases.

Next steps:

- Improve heatmap clarity and focus on pathological regions.

- Add bounding boxes to highlight optic disc/lens zone.

- Explore guided loss or attention regularization.

- Run heatmap drift comparison across image quality & diseases.
